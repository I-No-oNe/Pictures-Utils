## What is this project?
A useful program that I made that help me with some irl stuff\
(just editing photos for a shirt 😅)
## How to use?
- ***Run the command:***
```shell
pip install Pillow
```

- ***Run the `picturesUtils` file and choose the mode you need.***
- ***Paste the final result from the `output` folder.***
### IMPORTANT NOTE -> DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE FILE NAME TO `input.png`.

# What are the different modes?
```yml
# Mode 1 -> Change non-transparent pixels to white
# Mode 2 -> Change non-transparent pixels to black

```
